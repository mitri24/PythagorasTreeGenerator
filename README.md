# PythagorasTreeGenerator
This repository explores two approaches to drawing a branching, tree-like structure using recursion. The first version implements a classic Pythagoras tree with a fixed branching angle. The second version introduces randomness in the branching angle and segment height, creating a more organic and fractal-like appearance.
